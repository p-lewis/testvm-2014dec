Testing VM to show my issues starting up cassandra in titandb.

1. [Install vagrant][https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads]
2. Add the ubuntu trusty box `vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64`
3. Clone this repo
4. From the repo directory, `vagrant up`
5. You can `vagrant ssh` into the vm. Titan lives in `/vagrant/vendor`, and has not been started.
